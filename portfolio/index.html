        <h1 class="slideTitle">Step 1 - Design</h1>
        <p class="slideContent">
          I came up with 2 designs of this quiz but at the end, I went for a
          more minimal look. The design that I didn't use are down below. They
          were used to create V1.0.0 of this site but this is V2.0.0.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h1 class="slideTitle">Step 2 - Layout</h1>
        <p class="slideContent">
          The layout wasn't the hard part. I just had to make some elements of
          the website and style it. I do it by programming the basic element and
          styling them sperately. The following is a picture of programming
          those basic elements.

      <section>
        <h1 class="slideTitle">Step 3 - Getting the Questions</h1>
        <p class="slideContent">
          Getting the questions and displaying it was the hardest part about all
          this. I get my questions from an API (Application Programming
          Interface). That is basically a source which I call everytime you get
          a question correct and that provides me with the next question. I then
          display the questions, options and style them.

      <section>
        <h1 class="slideTitle">That's it!</h1>
        <p class="slideContent">
          That's it. That's how I made this quiz but it took 30+ hours of work.
          Imagine yourself just typing for 30 hours. It would cook your brain
          and that's exatly what happened with me. This project got my brain
          cooked multiple times but It was all worth it for 2 reasons. Number
          one, This was a school project so I had to do it. And number two, this
          goes on my resume so I'm happy. Did you do the quiz yet? Click
          <a href="/quiz/">here</a> to play this quiz. And as always, have a
          great day!
